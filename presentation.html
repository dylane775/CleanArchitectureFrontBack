    <h2>Vision of My PMO & QA Role</h2>

    <p>
        My vision of my role is to contribute to the success of the company’s projects by combining
        <strong>PMO responsibilities, ATS project governance, and software quality assurance (QA)</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a PMO, I aim to support the governance of ATS projects by helping structure project processes,
        improving coordination between stakeholders, and ensuring better visibility on project progress
        and decision-making.
    </p>

    <p>
        As a QA, my role is to help secure software deliverables by identifying defects as early as possible
        and contributing to continuous quality improvement.
    </p>

    <p>
        Through a progressive increase in skills and experience, my objective is to
        <strong>reduce project risks, improve the reliability and compliance of ATS deliverables,
        optimize delivery timelines, and strengthen collaboration between teams</strong>,
        while bringing sustainable value to the company.
    </p>
